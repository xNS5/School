# Game Programming

This was a group programming assignment done in Unity. I developed a bit of a knack for creating AI, so I volunteered to
develop the AI for our project.


I created 5 AI scripts:

1. Goblin
2. Skeleton
3. Golem
4. Hellhound
5. Boss: Minotaur

Each monster had a different attack style, applying different amounts of damage based on the monster's stats.

Each monster has a weapon, with the Hellhound being the exception. The Weapon Controller detects a collision with the player's
game object and subtracts health from the player's health script.
