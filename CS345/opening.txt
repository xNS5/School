Lights. Camera. Fall off the roof.
Welcome to Deadwood Studios, home of the million-movie month. You’re a bit actor with a simple dream. The dream of getting paid.
You and your cohorts will spend the next four days dressing up as cowboys, working on terrible films, and pretending you can act.
Your goal is to become the best actor in the backlot. Because it’s good to have goals.So strap on your chaps and mosey up to the roof.
Your line is “Aaaiiigggghh!”

Welcome to Deadwood.
