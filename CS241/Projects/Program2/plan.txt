1. For this assignment I will be implementing a PhyloTree class that creates a hierarchy of PhyloTree objects created from amino acid sequences for each species. So essentially I'll be creating objects that follows a tree structure based on a sequence of inputs for a species of animals in a set of species.

2. Just looking over the PhyloTree.java file, I think the countAllSpecies method and the various methods that involve counting something within the tree structure will be challenging. My partner and I had issues with the CountAllPaths method in the last program, but maybe this time around I'll be able to do it more efficiently. As I don't have the requirement to work with a partner outside of class, I think I might be able to put aside more time to work on this project, however I foresee myself working up until the last minute (as that's a distinct possibility).

3. I plan on utilizing:
	1. Brian, to clarify questions on overall concepts.
	2. Austin, now that there are office hours available I plan to utilize those.
	3. Mentor hours in CF162 and 164.

4. Timeline:

	5/23/18 - Begin development
	6/3/18 - Finish Development.

	Due to other classwork and tests I decided to delay starting the program. Because of this, I estimate that it will take me until the 3rd to finish.
