2. In its current state, I was wrestling with the buildTree and loadSpeciesFile method for so long I ran out of time to complete the 3 toString methods, and the
   method that calculates the evolutionary distances is spitting out the weighted height of the entire tree for some reason. It's most likely that the findTreeNodeByLabel points to
   the overall root of the tree which is causing the weight to spit out the overall weight of the tree.
3. I think that the way the program calculates the distances is inefficient. It required 2 for loops which would make the program lag on larger lists. Other than that, using the MultiKeyMap
   was really nice to use considering all I had to do was pipe in two species names to get their distances.
4. The most challenging parts of the assignment were easily the loadSpeciesFile and the buildTree methods. For loadSpeciesFile I wanted to make it as fast as possible, so instead of perhaps
   iterating through the list grabbing the species and then doing the same thing with the sequences, I opted to do a while loop and do a considerable number of conditionals. I struggled with
   stepping through the methods to find nullPointerExceptions when I didn't really understand why they occurred in the first place.
5. The first test file tested what the program did when the sequences were of differing length. The second test file just tested different sequences
6. I thought this assignment was incredibly intricate and difficult to understand. Overall, I learned a lot. But I wish I had more opportunities to go to office hours for longer
   whenever I came across a bug I didn't know how to fix. TA office hours were incredibly useful and Austin helped me an insane amount. At some points I felt that the pseudocode didn't
   really explain how to work some of the algorithms. The biggest errors I came across was the NullPointerExceptions. After going to the lines which were triggering it, I was often left confused
   as to why it wasn't functioning. Had I had more time, say, 3 weeks or even 2.5 weeks I might have completed this assignment in full. I found it was difficult to balance other class' assignments
   and the project because it was so complex. Even with a decent amount of time left, I was still struggling with starting.
