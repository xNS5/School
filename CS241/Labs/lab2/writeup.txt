For this assignment, I used the main method as a kind of menu of sorts, allowing the user to decide what they wanted to do with the program. For this assignment, I opted to make the container a class variable instead of passing it back and forth throughout the program. I felt that it would be easier. At the moment the container is an ArrayList, but I'm considering making it a LinkedList instead, considering it would be easier to remove nodes from a LinkedList than an ArrayList, but we'll see how that works out. Instead of using multiple if statments I chose to use a switch. The first method allows the user to add new records to the list. For the time being the method just runs once, but in the future when I actually program it, I might make it a while loop in case the user just happens to have multiple records they wish to input. For the UpdateList method, my intent is for the user to be able to search for an album or artist and return multiple albums/a specific album by the artist with the year it was released and the number of copies owned. The SearchList is pretty straightforward; it does pretty much the same thing as UpdateList minus the ability to update information. The last method, SortList, will sort all of the records by year.

All of my methods are void at the moment considering they don't actually return anything and are manipulating a global list (or class list, I haven't gotten my terminology down yet). The same applies to why they don't take anything in. When I actually code the meat of this program, I might find the need to pass things through these methods, but we shall see.

In case I decide to use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList, I've included a LinkedList class I've used before in CS145. Also included are the RecordCollection and Sorting classes. RecordCollection stores all of the relevant information about the record-- artist, album, year released, genre, and number of copies owned. I opted to pass the entire list to a separate class to sort instead of doing it within the main driver class. 

Note:

I wasn't 100% sure whether the RecordCollection class should have had the methods in the lab2 class or whether it would just store information, so I opted to keep the methods in the lab2 class for the time being.
