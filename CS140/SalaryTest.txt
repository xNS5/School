1)  I chose to test both of the example inputs and outputs on the lab document ( 38 hours, which resulted in $456 dollars, 45 hours which resulted in 570 dollars) These seemed like the easiest way to test whether my inputs would produce the expected outputs.

2) In the end it did. I wanted to have a little fun, so I added some unnecessary code which took me a little longer to work out. 

3) No, I didn't have to change my program.
