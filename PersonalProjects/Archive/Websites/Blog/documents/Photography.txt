My dad is the person that first got me into photography.
He's always had an artistic side to him that I never really appreciated when I was a kid.
One day during my sophomore year of College I had an idea: what if I got a film camera
so I could send pictures to my grandmother back home? 

I did my research, and I ended up purchasing an Olympus OM-10 off of facebook marketplace.
For a first camera, it was pretty okay. Not stellar or anything, but it helped me learn the basics of photography.

Later, he sent along a Nikon FM2 camera (another 35mm camera). After spending time with an 
Olympus camera, I can say I really enjoy Nikon lenses and bodies.

Finally, I ended up getting a Sony A6000 camera for my first digital camera. There
are things I like about it, and there are things I don't really care for. 

But here's the thing about my photo set up: I primarily use manual focus lenses. 
Being a semi-broke college student, a number of automatic focus camera lenses are
pretty expensive. There are some benefits to using them, but I wanted to spend less
on camera lenses. Having a good camera body is one part of the equation -- the other part
is having good lenses. I could drop $200+ on a decent lens and $500+ on really good lens, or
I could find a manual focus lens on Ebay that's on par with an auto focus lens for cheaper.
