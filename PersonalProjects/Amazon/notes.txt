For this project I want to design a program that sends me desktop notifications
if there's a chance in price for a product on amazon. I want to design this
in swift, and use some sort of database to keep track of price history.

On second thought, I might use Python instead of Swift. It looks like that
getting swift to connect to a mySQL database will be a pain, 
so it might be a better idea to use Python.

This is going to have a UI of sorts. 

Main app that shows current product watching, current price, other possible
information. Able to add it. Data potentially stored in the cloud. 

Table info:

1. Product ASIN (amazon ID number)
2. Product Cost
3. Product Name
4. Product link
