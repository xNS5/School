For this project I want to design a program that sends me desktop notifications
if there's a chance in price for a product on amazon. I want to design this
in swift, and use some sort of database to keep track of price history. 

This is going to have a UI of sorts. 

Main app that shows current product watching, current price, other possible
information. Able to add it. Data potentially stored in the cloud.
