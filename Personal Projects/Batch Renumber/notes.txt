List files in directory **COMPLETED
 
Check for spaces in folder names then rename appropriately **COMPLETED

Spit out file names and have either DONE or FAILED after conversion is finished **COMPLETED

Comment everything **COMPLETED

"N" for parent_child still not working. Null pointer resolved, not accepting valid dir names. **COMPLETED

Fix bug where only folders get renamed not the actual files. **COMPLETED.
   Issue: Wasn't assigning parent/child folders to strings. Changed folder names in ~/.../Photography/

Program is intermittently not going beyond the for loop at line 39. **COMPLETED
   Issue: the .delete() wasn't working properly.

After incorrectly inputting a folder name 1x times, inputting a correct file name registers as incorrect. **COMPLETED
   Issue: Within the while loop, the scanner was adding to the parent_folder not the child_folder


Work on creating a .jar or some other executable icon for this program. Last step once completely debugged

NEED TO FIX VARIABLE NAMES.
   Failing to convert to .jar resulted in all variable names getting fucked up. Fml. parent_child() is the issue right now. Fuck my life.

Add the following:
   * Method that lists files in a folder instead of creating a bunch of file objects
   * Method that validates the existence of folders and loops until completed
   * Some sort of sorting algorithm so I can go through and re-name files that have been renamed. 
         * Issue with Arrays.sort() is that if the files have already been sorted, it re-sorts in a weird way.
