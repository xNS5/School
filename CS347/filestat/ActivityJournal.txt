================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2:00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I'm going to start from the top and work my way down.

1. I'm going to verify that the input is correct (number of arguments, file exists)
2. Retrieve file details
3. Get file type
4. Get last time accessed, formatted to spec.
5. Lastly, I'm going to read the file permissions.

The last part potentially will give me some issues implementing, but I think I have an
idea how to approach it. I'll get to that once I complete steps 1-4.

Actual Time	3:00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
This assignment was fairly easy. The only part where I struggled was getting the last access time to work, but
that only happened in the first place because I accidentally used argv[2] as the input instead of argv[1].

After that, reading the file permissions was easy because I realized I could just use bitwise and to determine whether or not
the file was readable, writable, or executable in user, group, and other.

All in all, this assignment would have taken me less time had I gotten the right index in the beginning.
