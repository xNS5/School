Start
Estimated Time	1:00
Plan: I'm going to start at the first function and work my way down until all are completed.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	??:??
Observations:
I don't really know how long it took me in total because I chipped away at it incrementally.

I'm not as good at pointers as I thought I was. The pointer functions were surprisingly challenging, and I wasn't able
to use GDB to see what was going wrong and where. The last function was especially challenging for two reasons:

1. I was thinking of it more like a leetcode-style problem where I'd have to find the longest substring, but that wasn't the case here.

2. I got a little confused about the difference between `char* foo` and `char *foo`. A quick google search fixed that confusion.

I addressed the tests one at a time, and I was able to come up with solutions pretty quickly after taking a step back to think.

In the find_any_* and substring functions I opted to re-use the find_ch_* functions to assist. Using them definitely cut down on redundant code!

(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
