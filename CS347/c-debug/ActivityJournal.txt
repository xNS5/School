Start 7:00 PM
Estimated Time	00:30
Plan: Copy prime.c to prime_standard.c and adjust the variable names, definitions, then function names.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete 7:37 PM
Actual Time	00:37
Observations: After I renamed variables, I changed the way variables were assigned to reduce overall memory allocation (e.g. on line 42
I changed primes[1] = 1; primes[2] = 1; to primes[1] = 1, primes[2] = 1; and on line 43 I initialized i within the for loop instead of outside of it.
I tested the program and realized that in prime.c the original author had hardcoded 50 to the value of the upper bound. I commented it out to allow
the user input to be tested.

I found out later that the program would segfault after inputting a higher number, and I think it's because it tried to access unallocated memory in primes[]. I changed
the primes[] size to the size of the upper bound and it seemed to remedy that issue.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
