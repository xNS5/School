=============================
Start
Estimated Time : 06 00
Plan:
 -Read up on threads and convolutions (both)
 -Implement readImage (Josh)
 -Implement apply_filters (Michael)
 -Implement threadfn (both)
 -Implement write_image (Josh)
 -Debug and test (both)

==============================
Complete
Actual Time 3:00
Observations:

Michael:

I worked on apply_filters which generated threads. It was relatively quick work as
I have worked with threads and multi-threaded applications in C before. The description
of threadfn was a tad confusing, however I was able to  implement the loops after re-watching
the lecture video describing how to apply the filter. Josh completed threadfn by implementing
the image convolution. After that was done, I finished up the program by implementing a mutex
and the timer.

Josh:

I worked on reading and writing the image, which gave me some grief until I realized I needed
to consume the rest of a line until a new line character happened. Write image was fairly straight forward and I made sure to include ample error handling. I helped with apply_filters a bit as well as threadfn. This was my first experience with multithreading and I have to say that it is not as bad as I thought it would be. Very very informative project.
