IPC stands for "Inter process communication". Using the Kernel I can request that it
allocate memory specifically for inter-process communication. The processes can also communicate by having 
a file that's accessable to both of the processes. They can read, write, and open to said file.

In this assignment, I use the server file to create a shared memory object which can be accessed by the 
client. Using a timer, I could design a program that will pull data from a server at a set interval. Or, in turn, 
have the client store data in the shared memory object which gets read by the server. After a certain number of clocks, 
the function that pulls data from the shared memory object or store it in the shared memory object. After it gets pulled
from the shared memory object, the process would get put to sleep for a certain number of clocks, then gets woken up after
a certain number of clock cycles to either push or pull data from the shared memory object. This would allow two processes
to be synced up with the same data.
